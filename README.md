# ConvertMoney


👨‍💻This program prompts the user for the amount of money 

        to convert and the starting and destination currencies.

        It then uses the 🌐 exchangerate-api.com API to get real-time

        exchange rates, and performs the conversion by multiplying the

        amount of money by the destination currency's exchange rate. 

        ☑️Finally, it displays the result of the conversion to the user.
